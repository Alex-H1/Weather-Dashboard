# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

This weather dashbord app will let a user see the current weather along with other usefull data for anywhere in the world along with a five day forecast.

## Installation

We were not givin any starter code so the tools that I used for this app were HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. starting with the html there is a header and a search bar to search for cities. When the user presses the search button then will appear the weather forecast for the city along with a five day forcast for the given city. In the Java Script once the search button was clicked with a given city input then is placed inside of an api to then get the information about the weather. Once we have the weather data then made elements to populate the weather status and the process repeats for the five day forecast. Once the search button is pressed the given city will be pushed into an array and in local storege so the search history can be saved as a list in html and clicked to view the weather once more.
